Hello! I'm Jacopo, an MSc Student in Computer Science at *Universit√† Degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca* who's currently working as a technical advisor on an autonomous driving system project. You can reach me at:

[jack23247@pm.me](mailto:jack23247@pm.me),
https://github.com/jack23247.

I have an interest in computer architecture, system administration, networking, real-time systems and operating systems design in general. Thanks to my experience with old computers I've had the opportunity to experience many different ecosystems, including but not limited to: Linux, BSD, Solaris, MS-DOS, Windows, OpenVMS, OS/400, OS/370 and VM/370.

My first foray into programming was via scripting languages like CMD, PowerShell, Python and Ruby. Today I'm quite fond of C and C++ and I've had the opportunity to use LISP, Prolog and Java for my programming courses.

I've decided to stop collecting random stuff because it's getting way out of hand (I have too many AS/400s!), but if you have one of the following items you want to sell, please get in contact as I'm sure we can arrange something.

- A small boat
- An HP C8000 or ZX6000
- An IBM xSeries 382 (or any Itanium hw)
- A System/36 5363
- An Olivetti Linea 1 machine (M20, M30, M40, M45)
- A desktop Amiga
- An AlphaServer ES47 in a deskside cabinet
- A NEC SX-8i or SX-6i
- An IBM mainframe (preferably small like an S/390 MP3000)
- A Cray EL9x or SV1
- A Sun Enterprise 10k or 15k
- An SGI Origin {2,3}000
- Any weird system that runs Unix (the Olivetti LSX comes to mind)

If you're into the retrocomputing scene you'll notice that most of these are extremely specific, rare or downright unobtanium: if I can't find something, then it can't clutter my basement! :wink:
