Hello! I'm Jacopo, a BSc Graduate and future MSc Student in Computer Science at *Universit√† Degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca* who's currently working on projects regarding real-time computing, operating systems, and computer architecture. You can reach me at:

[jack23247@pm.me](mailto:jack23247@pm.me),
[j.maltagliati@campus.unimib.it](mailto:j.maltagliati@campus.unimib.it),

I have an interest in system administration, networking, real-time systems, operating systems and retrocomputing. Thanks to my experience with old computers I have used many opeownrating systems in the past, including but not limited to: Linux, BSD, Solaris, MS-DOS, Windows, OpenVMS, OS/400, OS/370 and VM/370. I'm quite fond of C and I have a background in scripting languages such as Bash, Ruby, Windows CMD and PowerShell. I've used LISP and Prolog and I'd like to learn more about languages such as Erlang and COBOL.

In case you want to sell one of the following items and are located near (< ~2500Km) from Milan, Italy, I'd love if you could get in touch with me:
- A small boat
- An HP C8000
- Any Itanium machine
- A Sun Ultra 45
- An SGI workstation that runs IRIX
- A Sharp X68000
- A System/36 5363

Additionally, here's a list of items I'd love (but I'm not likely to ever find):
- A NEC SX-8i or SX-6i
- A System/390 Multiprise 3000
- An AlphaServer ES47 in a deskside cabinet
- A Cray EL9x or SV1
- A Sun Enterprise 10k or 15k
- An SGI Origin {2,3}000

..or any other minisupercomputer for that matter.
