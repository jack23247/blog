In no particular order:

- I drive a 1991 Renault 4 TL called Carlotta
- I collect old, dirty and usless computers
  - I also collect cameras, some model cars and game consoles
    - I also collect shiny rocks
      - I also collect old books and manuals
        - Basically I'm an hoarder... ðŸ˜¢
- I study CS in Milan, Italy
- I'm a wannabe kernel developer (with no actual experience)
- I've been a designer and writer for a while
  - I've worked on newspapers, brochures, short movies, short plays...
- I'd love to work on racing cars' ECUs
- I have a black and white cat with no tail

Now that you know more about me, do you feel *fulfilled*?
