In no particular order:

- I drive a 1991 Renault 4 TL called Carlotta
- I collect old, dirty and usless computers
  - Sometimes I collect cameras, some model cars and game consoles
    - I also like to keep old books, manuals and software around
      - I can't resist shiny rocks, houseplants, old furniture, classic cars...
- I study CS in Milan, Italy
- I'd love to be a kernel developer and I'm getting quite fond of real-time systems
- I've been a designer and writer in my high school days
  - I've worked on newspapers, brochures, short movies, short plays...
- I have a black and white cat with no tail

Now that you know more about me, do you feel *fulfilled*?
