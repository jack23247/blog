### This quarter's book is: **The Soul of a New Machine** by Tracy Kidder.

Publshed in 1981, *The Soul of a New Machine* is a deep dive into the minds of
key people behind the design and implementation of the Data General Eclipse MV
series of computers, detailing both the unique and excruciating aspects of
working at one of the most important minicomputer companies of the 1970s.

## Background

While Data General has suffered a quick and steady demise after the
microcomputer wars of the 1980s, disappearing almost completely by the turn of
the millenium, in the 70s they were one of DEC's main competitors and used to
bring compelling solutions to market while often undercutting their rivals'
prices.

Kidder is a journalist who had the opportunity to spend several months in
close contact with figures such as Tom West, the architecture's chief designer
and Al Alsing, the manager of the microcode division: this experience lead him
to write this book, with which he won several awards, including a Pulitzer,
throughout the 1980s.

## Eagle

*Eagle* is the codename that's been given to the MV/8000's architecture, which
was essentially a backburner project for Data General, that had just backed
the development of a supposedly next-generation 32-bit architecture at the
time.

As a precaution, DG gave West the task to develop an evolution
of the existing Eclipse line, that could be used to fill the gaps in the
product line and offered to those customers who needed backwards
compatibility: knowing that there was a significant possibility that the other
product would never see the light of day, and fueled by his own ambition, West
took it upon himself to design and build not a simple "bag on the side of
Eclipse", but a true state-of-the-art 32-bit minicomputer.

Kidder then cleverly intertwines the description of each phase of the
development of Eagle with the outlining of each key individual in that phase,
portraying their character and emotions in a masterful way. This combination,
presented in a crisp and fluent writing style, leads to an immersing read
that's very enjoyable, but gets a bit stressing at times due to the author's
insane ability that will literally makes you feel like you're walking along
with him in the sweaty basement of Data Generals' headquarters.

## Wrapping Up

In his endeavor, the author excellently portrays each key individual by
highlighting their character, habits, and vices, ultimately giving us a clear
(albeit not complete) picture of how the individuality of the people who
worked on Eagle affected the design itself.

Ultimately, I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who's interested in
computers, history and a compelling story in general, as Kidder does not
indulge in overly technical details, and is able to present even the most
engineering-oriented parts of the story in human-readable terms.
